# Duplicate_Image_Finder

Knowing that I had several duplicate photos because of family members sharing the same ones at any given time, I needed a quick and easy way to weed out any duplicates from a collection of over 6,000 images from the past five years... on just my phone alone.

I am starting off simple and basic (welcome to Windows 95 GUI via Tkinter!); working my way to a more fancy and robust product. I'd like to eventually bundle this into a file management suite; handling more than just images and doing more than simply identifying and eliminating excess. When that time comes, I know I'll need to shift to a different language (I'm most familiar with Java but it looks like Rust, C++, and Go respectively are better options to learn).

This certainly isn't a finished project yet so anyone wanting to tinker with it and/or collaborate on it, please feel free! Also, I am a newbie coder (especially w/ Python) and this is my second solo project so any optimization tips/tricks are greatly appreciated.

To run locally as-is:
1) create & activate virtual Python environment
2) install dependencies from the provided requirements file (command line: pip install -r requirements.txt)
3) run your\file_path\python main.py
